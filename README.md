# Node CRM App
Node, Express, and MongoDB application that allows for the adding, removing, and updating of contacts from a database.

## How to Run: ##
Install node and MongoDB (see https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/?jmp=footer#mongodb-community-edition)<br><br>

Run ```npm install``` in CRM directory to get all project dependencies.<br>

Run mongo (platform dependent). In my example I created a db at localhost/CRMdb (you can change this in index.js)<br>

Run ```node index.js``` to listen on localhost:3000.<br><br>

Use your favourite http client to send requests. Example requests can be found in the postman collection attached.<br>
<b>Note:</b> there's no GUI for this project so don't be alarmed when you don't see anything.
